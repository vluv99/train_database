##  Project setup
1. After installing [node.js](https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.16.2/node-v12.16.2-x64.msi) *(version: v12.16.2)*

2. Download files from `gitKraken`.

3. Click on `setup.bat` script in the `scr` folder.
    - I made a bat file to make the node.js installation easier for you.
    - you only have to do this when we add new dependencies.

4. Open `Connection.js`, and change the username, password and connection string.
    - open visualstudio code
    - open Connection.js
    - edit data

5. Run `run_server.bat` script in the `scr` folder.
    - I made a bat file, so it's easier to start the server.
    - you have to click on it when you stat a session, or each time, when you make changes to the `server.js`

6. Click on [this](localhost:8081/test.html) to see the website.
    - the link contains: `localhost:8081/test.html`
    - later on this can change
